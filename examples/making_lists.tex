There are two main ways to create lists in LaTeX, enumerate (for numbered lists) and itemize. Here is an example using enumerate 

%As always we have to start the environment 
\begin{enumerate}
%Add items to the list via \item
\item This is a thing
\item This is another thing 
\end{enumerate}

The lists don't have to be numbered. Using itemize will give you bullet points (but you can change what they are). 
\begin{itemize}
%Again we add items to the list with \item 
\item Stuff
\item More stuff 
\end{itemize}
