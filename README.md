# uoit-latex-workshop
Welcome to the basics of LaTeX workshop held by the Physics and Health Physics Societies at UOIT!

We will be using Overleaf as our LaTeX editor.  Itâ€™s a browser-based editor which makes it really simple to write and share LaTeX code.   We recommend that you use this too, at least for this workshop. Feel free to use your own software if you prefer, but keep in mind that all of our examples and instructions will be based on Overleaf.  If you do choose to use Overleaf, please make a free account ahead of time so that we can get started right away.

We will be covering the following basic topics:

Adding figures, making lists, math mode, creating tables, title pages and making a table of contents. 

The workshop will continue to build on one document but standalone examples can be found in the Examples folder. To get these files you can clone this repository or download the zipfile that is linked on the side of this page.
